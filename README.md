## 📧 Spam Mail Detection Using Python & Streamlit

### Overview
This project is a **machine learning-based spam mail detector** built using Python and Streamlit. It classifies messages as either spam or not spam using a Naive Bayes classifier trained on real-world email data.

### 🚀 Features
- Text preprocessing and vectorization using `CountVectorizer`
- Classification using `MultinomialNB` from scikit-learn
- Interactive web UI built with **Streamlit**
- Visual insights and performance metrics

### 🗂️ Dataset
The model is trained on a labeled dataset containing spam and ham emails, stored in a CSV file. Make sure the file `spam.csv` is located in the root directory of the project before running the app.



### 🔧 Installation & Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spam-mail-detection.git

# Navigate to the project folder
cd spam-mail-detection

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the Streamlit app
streamlit run SpamDetection.py
```




### 🧠 How It Works
1. Emails are converted into numerical vectors using `CountVectorizer`.
2. A Naive Bayes model predicts whether the email is **Spam** or **Not Spam**.
3. Results are displayed instantly in an interactive web interface.

### 📌 Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- Streamlit

### 📬 Future Improvements
- Support for larger and more diverse datasets
- Model performance visualization with charts
- Option to train on custom uploaded datasets

### 📄 License
This project is open-source under the MIT License.
